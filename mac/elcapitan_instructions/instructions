Install brew on el capitan

To install qt type :

brew install qt

to install pyqt type:

brew install pyqt

for vtk type

-------------------- obsolete kept just to keep track of changes--------------------
brew install vtk

Interestingly even though vtk will be compiled with default apple-provided compiler it will link to cc3d compiled with gcc-5.3
-------------------- end of obsolete kept just to keep track of changes--------------------

IMPORTANT: ACTUALLY IT IS BEST NOT TO install vtk using bre but build it using standard apple compilers. those vtk libs will lnk to
other libs compiled using gcc-5.3

If you installed vtk fusing brew and want to keep it, you need to rename the following
/usr/local/Cellar/vtk -> /usr/local/Cellar/vtk-old
/usr/local/Cellar/jpeg - > /usr/local/Cellar/jpeg-old
/usr/local/Cellar/libpng - > /usr/local/Cellar/libpng
/usr/local/Cellar/libtiff - > /usr/local/Cellar/libtiff-old

prior to compiling vtk  so that those libraries are not picked up by the vtk cmake configure script.
It is best to use defaul OSX provided libraries to make distribution of packages easier

Also those changes need to be in place when compiling CC3D



You may try various compilers provided by brew but it turned out they all had old openMP bug so instead go to

http://hpc.sourceforge.net and get modern gcc

To install gcc simply unpack gcc-5.3 to folder of your choice and then when using cmake make sure to point cmake to use this compiler instead of the default one. In cmae gui
you have an option to specify compilers




copy dependencied into /Users/m/Deps

copy rpathModifier scripts into /Users/m/Deps

run rpathModifier scripts using python interpreter

e.g.

python rpathPodifierPyQt4.py

it will create rpathizerPyQt4.sh shell sceipt

change permissions for this script to xecutable nd execute the script

depending on the librry you may need to execute this script as sudo (especially if you see errors after non-sudo run)

sudo ./rpathizerPyQt4.sh

At this point you will have PyQt libraries converted to use @rpath

You will need to do so for Qt libraries and any other libraries that you will be copying to the Deps folder and distributing with your application

Note that if you run cc3d (or any other software) and get complained that a library cannot be found see which library is giving this error

and run

otoool -L library_with_missing_link_error


Python executable

cp /System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/Resources/Python.app/Contents/MacOS/Python ./cc3d_python

--------------- OLD
create python virtual environment by typing

virtualenv my_python

this will create virtual environment

copy python frmo my_python/bin/python to Deps folder and rename it to cc3d_python
----------------- END OF OLD
