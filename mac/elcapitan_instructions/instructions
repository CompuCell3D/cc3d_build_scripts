Install brew on el capitan

To install qt type :

brew install qt 

to install pyqt type:

brew install pyqt

for vtk type

brew install vtk

Interestingly even though vtk will be compiled with default apple-provided compiler it will link to cc3d compiled with gcc-5.3

You may try various compilers provided by brew but it turned out they all had old openMP bug so instead go to 

http://hpc.sourceforge.net and get modern gcc

To install gcc simply unpack gcc-5.3 to folder of your choice and then when using cmake make sure to point cmake to use this compiler instead of the default one. In cmae gui 
you have an option to specify compilers




copy dependencied into /Users/m/Deps

copy rpathModifier scripts into /Users/m/Deps

run rpathModifier scripts using python interpreter

e.g. 

python rpathPodifierPyQt4.py

it will create rpathizerPyQt4.sh shell sceipt

change permissions for this script to xecutable nd execute the script

depending on the librry you may need to execute this script as sudo (especially if you see errors after non-sudo run)

sudo ./rpathizerPyQt4.sh

At this point you will have PyQt libraries converted to use @rpath

You will need to do so for Qt libraries and any other libraries that you will be copying to the Deps folder and distributing with your application

Note that if you run cc3d (or any other software) and get complained that a library cannot be found see which library is giving this error 

and run

otoool -L library_with_missing_link_error


Python executable 

cp /System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/Resources/Python.app/Contents/MacOS/Python ./cc3d_python

--------------- OLD
create python virtual environment by typing

virtualenv my_python

this will create virtual environment

copy python frmo my_python/bin/python to Deps folder and rename it to cc3d_python
----------------- END OF OLD
