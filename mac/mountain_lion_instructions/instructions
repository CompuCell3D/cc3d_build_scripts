To compile llvm 3.5 and higher on osx mountain lion you may need to enable 
LLVM_ENABLE_CXX

if you get an error about missing libstdc++4.7

also since we are using python 2.6 for this osx version you need to switch python version in cmake for llvm

When building RR dependencies and RR make sure to set 
CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS_RELEASE=-O3 -DNDEBUG -std=c++11 -stdlib=libc++
