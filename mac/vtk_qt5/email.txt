Dear Customer service Folks at Hotwire

I booked a hotel room for 4 people in Rocky Mount, NC (in Dec 22 2015, out Dec ) Itinerary: 6290057888. Upon arrival it turned out that the hotel did not have room with 2 beds. I called customer support at Hotwire and I was advised to book a comparable hotel and I will be reimbursed for my additional cost. I did that and I am attaching a receipt for reimbursement

I am looking forward to hearing back from you

Sincerely

Maciej swat
