In this writeup we will show how to setup CC3D on already existing AWS Ubuntu 18.04 image

We are assuming that we are connecting from a Linux machine.


setting up private key
-----------------------

After generating AWS keys during AWS instance creation we save them in a secure folder, ideally, ``~./ssh`
on local machine. Next, we change private key to have file permissions set to  400

.. code-block:: console

    chmod 400 <path_to_private_key>

connect
-------

To connect to AWS instance without X11 forwarding (e.g. right after creating AWS instance) use the following:

.. code-block:: console

    ssh -i <full path to private key for a given instance> ec2-3-135-208-xxx.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com

the ec2-3-135-208-xxx.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com can be found on the instance page

Installations
-------------

After initial login run

.. code-block:: console

    sudo apt-get update

This will fetch ubuntu packages so that you can install some on your system

then you can install all the stuff you want to

Install CC3D
------------

On AWS image with ubuntu 18.04 we do the following:

We first install ``xterm`` to make sure we can forward X11 windows

.. code-block:: console

    sudo apt-get install xterm

This single command will install all dependencies needed to forward X11 windows

On some ubuntu version e.g. 20.04 you may also need to install ``libncurses5`` if you want lib road runner to work

.. code-block:: console

    sudo apt-get install libncurses5

Next, we disconnect and connect again to  to AWS instance but this time we will request  X11 window forwarding
so that we can see and interact with GUI's

.. code-block:: console

    ssh -X -i <full path to private key for a given instance> ec2-3-135-208-xxx.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com

Notice ``-X`` switch that enables X11 window forwarding

.. code-block:: console

    wget https://sourceforge.net/projects/cc3d/files/4.2.0/linux/Ubuntu_18.04_64bit/CC3D_4.2.0_ubuntu_18.04_64bit.tar.gz

once the download finishes we install it as follows:

.. code-block:: console

    tar -xvf CC3D_4.2.0_ubuntu_18.04_64bit.tar.gz

Using Existing AMI image to launch AWS instance with CC3D installed
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The easiest way to install start using CC3D on AWS is to use existing image with CC#D installation.
In this example we will use publicly available Amazon Machine Image (AMI) called ``cc34_4.2.0_minimal``.
Yes, there is a typo in the image name but it does not matter what the image is called.

Step 1
~~~~~~

Locate ``cc34_4.2.0_minimal`` in publicly available AMIs. To do so click AMIs in the ``Images`` link in the
left panel of AWS console

In the search box panel make sure you select "Public Images" from pull down menu and type ``cc34_4.2.0_minimal``
in the actual search box. Select this image

|AMI_image_search|

Step 2
~~~~~~

Launch a virtual machine with this image. Note, this image has already CC3D installed so after you launch
the virtual machine with this image you will be ready to run simulations. Launching is as easy as
clicking ``Launch`` button:

|action_launch|

This will take you to a page where you will select actual virtual machine configuration. Make sure you
choose machine specs that are suitable for your needs. Here we have chosen ``t2.xlarge`` instance with 3 CPUs
and 16 GB RAM. When selecting the machine make sure you are aware of costs. Larger machines cost more

|select_instance_configuration|

Click ``Review and Launch`` and after few minutes the instance will be ready for use.

You might be asked to generate ssh key that you will use to authenticate.
Make sure you do it during first launch. Later, when you start new instances of virtual machines you might
reuse existing key. Make sure you store this key in secure location

Step 3
~~~~~~

Connect to the instance.IN the left-hand panel click instances and verify that your newly launched machine
is ready . It may take few minutes for machine to be ready so be aware of this.  Once you see machine is ready
to use, select it (blue square) and click ``Connect`` button. It will display instructions on how to
connect to your machine (you will see actual IP address in this pop up dialog)

|connect_to_launched_instance|

The actual command i typed was as follows:

.. code-block:: console

    ssh -Y -i ~/.ssh/ubuntu_18_t2_medium.pem ubuntu@ec2-18-217-205-200.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com

where ``-Y`` switch activates X11 Window forwarding and ``-i ~/.ssh/ubuntu_18_t2_medium.pem`` is a location of
a private key that I generated in Step 2. Note that in your case that actual IP address of
the virtual machine might differ but you will see this in the pop-up dialog that displays after you click
``Connect``

.. warning::

    make sure you are ssh-ing as user ``ubuntu``. simply change ``root@ec2-18-217-20...`` to ``ubuntu@ec2-18-217-20...`` in the ssh command

|connect_ssh|

Step 4
~~~~~~

Run CC3D. After you log in to your AWS instance. you will land in the home directory. If you type

.. code-block:: console

    ls

you will see ``CC3D_4.2.0_ubuntu_18.04_64bit`` folder. This is where CC3D is installed

Launch ``xterm``

.. code-block:: console

    xterm&

|ls_xterm|

and then do the following:

.. code-block:: console

    cd CC3D_4.2.0_ubuntu_18.04_64bit
    ./compucell3d.sh

This will Launch CC3D.

|cc3d_first_lanuch|

Step 5
~~~~~~

Copy simulation files to your AWS instance. Here we will use SCP

The command is quite simple

.. code-block:: console

    scp -i ~/.ssh/ubuntu_18_t2_medium.pem nh-cc3d-covid-tissue-response-model-master.zip ubuntu@ec2-18-217-205-200.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:~

As before ``-i ~/.ssh/ubuntu_18_t2_medium.pem`` is key-based authentication for scp. Works in the similar way
as with ssh , as we described above. We are copying our model ``nh-cc3d-covid-tissue-response-model-master.zip``
to home directory of AWS instance: ``ubuntu@ec2-18-217-205-200.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:~``

Make sure to run this command from your "home" computer

Step 6
~~~~~~

Run Covid simulation in AWS instance. After copying simulation zip file we can unpack it and move to
wherever we want to store it. Hint, I am using Midnight Mommander that is also installed on this ubuntu instance
Type

.. code-block:: console

    mc

if you want to use it. If not you can use command line , and this is fine as well

When we load the simulation and hit Play the simulation runs and this is final result:

|cc3d_on_aws|

Step 7
~~~~~~

After you finish running turn off the instance so that you are not being charged for usage. To do so
Go to instances panel and in the ``Actions`` pull-down menu choose ``Instance State -> Stop``

|instance_stop|

Managing multiple simulations from a single console
---------------------------------------------------

When you connect to a remote server hosted by AWS (or any other service) one question you may
have is whether you need to keep your terminal open while the simulaton is running.
If you would like to see a GUI then the answer is , yes, you need to keep terminal open. However,
often you want to run simulation in the batch model using ``runScript`` and in this case you can
start the simulation in the background and either completely logout or start fea other simulations
from the same terminal an switch between them. To accomplish this task we will use ``screen`` utility
that should be installable in every linux. For basic tutorial on how to use ``screen`` please see

https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-use-linux-screen/

After you connect to AWS terminal with running linux version that has CC3D do the following:

1. Create new screen within terminal

.. code-block:: console

    screen -R cc3d_1

.. note::

    ``cc3d_1`` that we used here is a label that you give to name a screen. Ths label can be arbitrary

2. Go to a directory where CC3D is installed

.. code-block:: console

    cd ~/CC3D_4.2.0_ubuntu_18.04_64bit

3. Start a simulation

.. code-block:: console

    c./runScript.sh -i <simulation_full_path> -f 1000

.. note::

    ``-f 1000`` options tells CC3D to store complate visualization snapshots every 1000 MCS. See CompuCell3D manual for other command line options


4. Detach screen that runs the simulation. Now that the simulation is running you can exit the screen
and either start new simulation or completely logged out of the computer. To detach screen you
type ``Ctrl+a`` followed ``d`` - so ``Ctrl+a , d``
Once you do it the simulation runs in the background

5. List all the screens

.. code-block::

    screen -ls


This will list all the screens you have (including ``cc3d_1``)

6. Go back to existing screen to check on simulation

.. code-block::

    screen -r cc3d_1

Notice that I used lower-case letter `r` to go back to screen

7. Now you can detach again and starte new screen for new simulation. So ``Ctrl+a, d`` followed by

.. code-block:: console

    screen -R cc3d_2

We created new screen ``cc3d_2`` and now when we do

.. code-block:: console

    screen -ls

we would see ``cc3d_1`` and ``cc3d_2``. If both screens are runnign simulation we can easily switch between
screens using combination of ``Ctrl+a, d`` (detach) and ``screen -r <screen_name>`` (attach)

8. Finally, when you are done with a screen and your simulation is finished and you want to simply exit
the screen you simply type ``Ctrl+d``


X-Window Forwarding
-------------------

To run CC3D in the GUI mode you need to make sure that linux (running in AWS cloud) can forward
windows to your computer. If you are on OSX or Windows you need to install 3rd party tools
that facilitate this task. Some of them are free some of them you need to pay. However,
one solution that is always available to you is to install VirtualBox (or VMWare Workstation Player)
and install under those virtualization platforms your favorite linux. Then use this linux to connect
to AWS and this way you will ensure that X-window forwarding works
