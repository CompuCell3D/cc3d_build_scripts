conda create -n cc3d_2017 python
conda install nomkl numpy
conda install pyqt vtk
conda install jinja2 
pip install webcolors
conda install pyqtgraph
conda install pyzmq
pip install cma

to allow compilation of FieldExtractor from pyinterface using conda's vtk we need to make a link 

/usr/lib64 pointing to /home/m/miniconda2/envs/cc3d_2017/bin , simply type

sudo ln -s /home/m/miniconda2/envs/cc3d_2017/bin /usr/lib64

on linux the installation of pyqt5/qt5 is messed up. At least with this current version of conda. 

to fix installation of PyQt5 in miniconda we need to make links inside /home/m/miniconda2/envs/cc3d_2017/bin
to every single directory in /home/m/miniconda2/envs/cc3d_2017

we also need to copy include all qt include directories from /home/m/miniconda2/envs/cc3d_2017/include/qt to /home/m/miniconda2/envs/cc3d_2017/include

NExt we need to download and compile QScintilla 2.9.3 (later versions will not work with pyqt installation distributes with conda - v 5.6.0 - I am sure this will change in the future though and we will be able to use latest QScintilla)

we also change the content of qt.conf inside /home/m/miniconda2/envs/cc3d_2017/bin to:
.[Paths]
Prefix = ../
Binaries = ../bin
Libraries = ../lib
Headers = ../include/qt

After this we can copy entire python environment to cc3d installartion directory : 

/home/m/miniconda2/envs/cc3d_2017 -> <CC3D_install_DIR>/Python27



we need to fix pyqtgraph 
We need to patch installation of pyqtgraph by commenting out the wollowing lines in <prerequisites_folder>\Python27\Lib\site-packages\pyqtgraph\widgets\GraphicsView.py :

        # from .. import _connectCleanup
        # _connectCleanup()
