After you install conda environment that includes numpy youu may want to install libroadrunner

normally you would type

pip install libroadrunner

and libroadrunner will get installed.

if you run python and there type

import roadrunner

you should see that import suceeded.

Sometimes you will get an error compaining about wrong version of numpy :

"""module compiled against API version 0xc but this version of numpy is 0xb"

in tyhis situation you may need to install a different version of libroadrunner

to check available versions of libroadrunner you could use a pip hack:

pip install libroadrunner==

you will get pip error message that will include all available versions of libroadrunner.

then you would uninstall existing libroadrunner (the one that has numpy version conflict):

pip uninstall libroadrunner

and install new version

pip install libroadrunner=1.4.24

This typically should fix your problems
